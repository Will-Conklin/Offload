# Archived Plans

## Purpose

Preserve completed or superseded plans for historical reference.

## Authority

Same authority as plans, but no longer active. Archived plans are historical records and must not reintroduce scope or decisions.

## What belongs here

- Completed plans with outcomes recorded.
- Superseded plans retained for audit or context.

## What does not belong here

- Active plans or ongoing work items (use plans/).
- New requirements, decisions, or design changes.

## Canonical documents

- [Consolidated Implementation Plan: Offload iOS App](./plan-archived-consolidated-implementation-plan.md)
- [Plan: Capture Event-Sourced Model](./plan-archived-brain-dump-model.md)
- [Offload Polish Phase Implementation Plan](./plan-archived-polish-phase.md)
- [Critical Issues Remediation Plan](./plan-archived-remediation-plan.md)
- [Remediation Progress Tracking](./plan-archived-remediation-tracking.md)

## Naming

- Keep the original filename when archiving to preserve links.
- Use kebab-case and avoid renaming archived plans.
