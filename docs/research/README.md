# Research

## Purpose

Capture exploratory research, spikes, benchmarks, and reviews.

## Authority

Lowest authority. Research is non-authoritative and must not define requirements, decisions, or plans.

## What belongs here

- Exploratory notes, competitive analysis, and UX research.
- Trend studies, benchmarks, and review write-ups.

## What does not belong here

- Product requirements or scope (use prd/).
- Architecture or product decisions (use adr/).
- Implementation plans or schedules (use plans/).

## Canonical documents

- [ADHD-First UX and UI Guidance for Offload](./research-adhd-ux-ui.md)
- [Color Scheme Options for Offload](./research-color-palettes.md)
- [Color Scheme Alternatives for Offload](./research-color-scheme-alternatives.md)
- [iOS UI Trends Research & Recommendations for Offload](./research-ios-ui-trends-2025.md)
- [Code Review: Main Branch - Comprehensive Analysis](./reviews/research-2026-01-04-main-branch-review.md)

## Naming

- Use kebab-case for topic-based research files.
- Use date prefixes for time-bound work (for example, reviews).
- Group specialized research under subfolders like `reviews/`.
