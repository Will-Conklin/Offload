# Offload — V1 Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Product overview

**Offload** is an iOS app for adults with ADHD that reduces mental overload by allowing users to quickly capture thoughts and optionally organize them with AI. The app prioritizes **externalizing first**, **organizing later**, and **never forcing structure**.

---

## 2. Problem statement

Users experience stress when ideas, tasks, or plans accumulate faster than they can organize them. Existing tools require upfront categorization, which increases avoidance.

**Core user pain:**
> “I need this out of my head now, but organizing it feels like too much.”

---

## 3. Product goals (V1)

- Enable instant thought capture with minimal friction
- Provide optional, trustworthy AI-assisted organization
- Reduce cognitive load without introducing pressure or guilt
- Validate willingness to pay for AI-assisted relief

---

## 4. Non-goals (explicit)

- No automatic task creation without confirmation
- No calendar scheduling or reminders
- No collaboration or sharing
- No cross-platform support
- No complex onboarding flows

---

## 5. Target audience

- Adults with ADHD (diagnosed or self-identified)
- High cognitive load (work, family, planning)
- Comfortable with mobile-first tools
- Sensitive to stress-inducing UX patterns

---

## 6. Success metrics (30-day post-launch)

- ≥25% Day-30 retention for users who complete ≥1 AI organize action
- ≥40% of free users hit monthly AI limit
- 8–12% conversion from free → paid after limit hit
- App Store rating ≥4.5

---

## 7. Core user flows

### 7.1 Primary flow

1. User captures a thought (text or voice)
2. Thought is immediately saved to **Inbox**
3. User optionally taps **Organize**
4. AI returns structured suggestions
5. User reviews and confirms
6. Items are saved to lists/projects

### 7.2 Fallback flow

- If AI unavailable or limit reached:
  - Thought remains in Inbox
  - User sees: “Saved. Organize later.”

---

## 8. Functional requirements

### 8.1 Thought capture

- Text input (single field)
- Voice recording
  - One-tap record/stop
  - On-device transcription
- Works offline
- Immediate persistence

**Stored data**

- Raw text (immutable)
- Timestamp
- Source (text / voice)
- Status (inbox / organized)

---

### 8.2 Inbox

- Chronological list of all thoughts
- Visual distinction between:
  - Unorganized
  - Organized
- Actions:
  - Organize
  - Delete
  - Re-organize

Inbox is never auto-cleared.

---

### 8.3 AI organization (manual only)

Triggered only by user action.

AI classifies thought into:

- Task list
- Shopping list
- Plan (multi-step)
- Note (fallback)

**AI output requirements**

- Strict structured JSON
- Confidence score per item
- Optional clarification questions
- Never invent tasks beyond user intent

---

### 8.4 Review screen (critical trust feature)

User must be able to:

- Edit titles
- Edit item text
- Remove items
- Change destination list/project
- Cancel without losing original thought

**No data is committed without confirmation.**

---

### 8.5 Lists & projects

- Task lists
- Shopping lists
- Simple project grouping (tasks only)
- No due dates required
- No reminders in V1

---

## 9. Pricing & limits (hybrid model)

### Free tier

- 30 AI organization actions per month
- Unlimited capture
- Unlimited manual lists

### Paid tier (single SKU)

- Unlimited AI (soft caps enforced)
- Faster processing
- Early feature access

### Enforcement

- Limits enforced server-side
- Graceful fallback messaging
- No dark patterns

---

## 10. AI & backend requirements

### Architecture

iOS App → Backend API → LLM Provider

### Backend responsibilities

- User/session identification
- Quota enforcement
- LLM request/response handling
- JSON schema validation
- Minimal logging

### Privacy constraints
